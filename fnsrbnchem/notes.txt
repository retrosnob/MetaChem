Add repr methods. __repr__ is a string representation for the developer, while __str__ is a string representation for the user.

Need to decide what is instance, class and static in the methods. Instinct is to massively simplify the classes and just keep
the functions at the module level.

Make the class -> module changes and then do a test of bonding two interaction sites twice in a row to take them back to where they were.
